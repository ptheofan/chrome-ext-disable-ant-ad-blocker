# chrome-ext-disable-ant-ad-blocker

Lately the popularity of stupid anti-ad-blocker messages on websites have increased. I don't like that.
This extension will kill the anti-ad-blocker on business-insider. Feel free to adjust by creating a disabler per
website and adding the corresponding js under the correct url in manifest.jso

May the ad-blockers be with us.
